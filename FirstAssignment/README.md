This project represents my first foray into distributed systems, where I had the opportunity to design and implement a small-scale RMI-based server for remote file management. Using Java RMI, I created a robust system allowing users to download, upload, delete, and list files on a remote server. Additionally, our group incorporated a custom file operation to enhance the system's functionality. This project provided valuable insights into distributed computing and remote communication, showcasing our skills in both server-side and client-side implementations.
